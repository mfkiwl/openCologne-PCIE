# SW Architecture

This is where the developers of the software part of our **PIO TestApp** describe their work.

We plan on creating not one, but three examples, for the three representative compute platforms:
1) **Hard Embedded / Hosted**: RaspberryPi
2) **Soft Embedded / BareMetal**: Artix-7 FPGA acting as a RootComplex with soft on-chip RISC-V CPU
3) **General-purpose dektop/server class**: Linux PC
